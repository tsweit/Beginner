<h1>Learning HTML is fun</h1>
<h2>This is a practice page which was created by the use of only <strong>HTML</strong></h2>
<p>HTML uses tags to identify contents that will be displayed on a website. The tags also have attributes and these attributes can be informative or functional.</p>
<p>Nesting involves opening an element tag inside another tag. for example the word <em>child</em> and <em>emphasis</em> will be italics because I added the <strong>"em"</strong> tag to them within the paragraph tag. The <strong>"P"</strong> tag is the parent and the <strong>"em"</strong> tag is the child.</p>
<p>A line break <strong>"br"</strong> tag breaks the flow of a sentence and starts it on the next line.<br>as shown here.</p>
