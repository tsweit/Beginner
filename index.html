<h1>Learning HTML is fun</h1>
<h2>This is a practice page which was created by the use of only <strong>HTML</strong></h2>
<p>HTML uses tags to identify contents that will be displayed on a website. The tags also have attributes and these attributes can be informative or functional.</p>
<p>Nesting involves opening an element tag inside another tag. for example the word <em>child</em> and <em>emphasis</em> will be italics because I added the <strong>"em"</strong> tag to them within the paragraph tag. The <strong>"P"</strong> tag is the parent and the <strong>"em"</strong> tag is the child.</p>
<p>A line break <strong>"br"</strong> tag breaks the flow of a sentence and starts it on the next line.<br>as shown here.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying special characters</strong><br>Special characters can be characters that cannot be typed with a keyboard for example the trademark and copyright symbols. A special character can also be a symbol that is reserved for use by HTML for example the left and right angle brackets used for tags.<br>If I intend to show the "&lt;" and "&gt;" without rendering issues as shown above I will have to identify the name character entity for each symbol and add it to the ampersand symbol as shown here as well "&trade;" "&copy;".</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Displaying Images</strong><br>When displaying images, we have to use the "img" tag and tell the browser where to get the image from. We can also change the weight and height of the image.<br>
The <b>src</b> attribute tells the browser where to find the image and the <b>alt</b> attribute allows users to add a description.</p>
<img src="images/tag image.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="">
